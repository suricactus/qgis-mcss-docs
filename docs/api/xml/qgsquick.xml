<title>Overview</title>
<para>QGIS Quick is a QT Quick based GUI library primarily for mobile/tablet devices. Covering basic GIS components (e.g. MapCanvas, Scalebar), it simplifies creation of a mobile applications for surveys, data gathering or other on-site work. Qt Quick provides tools to create a rich application with a fluid and dynamic user interface. Additionally, Qt Quick Controls 2 provides highly optimized controls for embedded/mobile devices with limited resources.</para><para>QGIS Quick consists of a Qt plugin that provides the QML components and of a shared library that can be used from C++ code.</para><sect2 id="qgsquick_1qgsquick_overview_widgets">

<title>FeatureForm</title>
<para>A form listing attributes of a given feature. It supports basic edit field widgets for types such as edit text, map value, checkbox, date/time picker or external resource (photo capture). </para></sect3>
<sect3 id="qgsquick_1qgsquick_overview_widgets_positionmarker">
<title>PositionMarker</title>
<para>The element refers to current position according gps location device connected to it. It holds information about longitude, latitude, altitude, direction of the movement and accuracy of the signal. See also <ref refid="classQgsQuickPositionKit" kindref="compound">QgsQuickPositionKit</ref>. </para></sect3>
<sect3 id="qgsquick_1qgsquick_overview_widgets_scalebar">
<title>ScaleBar</title>
<para>A QML component that shows the scale ratio between its length and distance on the MapCanvas. There are predefined rounded values for several zooming levels with &apos;m&apos; or &apos;km&apos; postfixes. After any zoom in/out event on canvas recalculates its properties and updates text. See also <ref refid="classQgsQuickScaleBarKit" kindref="compound">QgsQuickScaleBarKit</ref>. </para></sect3>
<sect3 id="qgsquick_1qgsquick_overview_widgets_messagelog">
<title>MessageLog</title>
<para>A simple panel which can be used for publishing logs messages to a user such as basic information about the application or its status. See also <ref refid="classQgsQuickMessageLogModel" kindref="compound">QgsQuickMessageLogModel</ref>.</para></sect3>

<sect1 id="qgsquick_1qgsquick_styling">
<title>Styling</title>
<para>Since the QGIS Quick library is meant to be reusable for a wide variety of applications with different styles/themes of the user interface, some effort has been done to allow developers customize the colors and layouts of the components. Individual components either have attributes for customization (e.g. ScaleBar has &quot;barColor&quot;, &quot;barBackgroundColor&quot; properties) or more complex components accept a custom styling object (e.g. FeatureForm has &quot;style&quot; property of type FeatureFormStyling with a hierarchy of color and layout properties).</para></sect1>
<sect1 id="qgsquick_1qgsquick_versioning_api">
<title>Versioning and API stability</title>
<para>QML engine supports versioning of individual components with libraries - a single component may be available in multiple versions with slightly different set of features. This is allows QML libraries to keep API compatibility with older code.</para><para>QGIS Quick library is currently in version 0.1 and since it is still a very new library, there are no API stability guarantees: the following releases of QGIS may ship updates to components while keeping the same version or even remove some components. Over time we expect that as the library will become stable, we will deliver stable API just like with the other QGIS libraries.</para></sect1>
<sect1 id="qgsquick_1qgsquick_gui">
<title>Designing scalable applications</title>
<para>Qt Quick uses pixel sizes for the visual items. When building applications that may run on devices with varying screen DPI, this is a problem as the absolute pixel values make the application look different depending on the screen pixel density. We recommend to use values device independent pixels (&quot;dp&quot;). It is a concept used on mobile devices, where an item of width of 10dp will have always the same physical size (e.g. in millimeters) regardless of the screen density. To set width of an item to 10dp in QML, one would write: &quot;width: 10 * QgsQuick.Utils.dp&quot;.</para></sect1>
<sect1 id="qgsquick_1qgsquick_lib">
<title>Building the library</title>
<para>The QGIS Quick library is not built by default because QGIS application currently does not use it. In order to build the library please make sure that WITH_QUICK variable in CMake configuration is set to ON.</para><para>It is recommended to build with CMake variable ENABLE_TESTS set to ON because that will also build a small example application that uses Qt Quick components. In the generated project you should see target &quot;qgis_quickapp&quot;.</para><para>The built QML plugin is installed to a dedicated directory - see <ref refid="classQgsApplication_1aa99e144099c85b6ed1f3d9e5d9e91972" kindref="member">QgsApplication::qmlImportPath()</ref>. When using QGIS Quick components, it is necessary to either use QQmlEngine::addImportPath() to add that directory or to specify QML2_IMPORT_PATH environment variable.</para></sect1>
<sect1 id="qgsquick_1qgsquick_demo_app">
<title>Demo application</title>
<para>A demo application with some basic componets and functionality is available on <ulink url="https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-quick-demo-app">https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-quick-demo-app</ulink></para><para>The demo application repository contains also instructions on how to build the application, QGIS Quick and other dependencies on Android. </para></sect1>
